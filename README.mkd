# Tracy profiler clients in Rust

This project contains Rust crates for producing [Tracy profiler](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy)
traces. Tracy features nanosecond precision, ability to profile remotely and a full-featured
graphical interface for finding hot spots in profiled programs.

While Tracy's support for Rust is not first-class, it is still a very potent tool. If you have an
application instrumented with the `tracing` crate, Tracy can be used with your program in minutes
via the `tracing-tracy` crate. It can work well as both a profiling and, to a lesser extent,
an observability tool.

## Important note

Depending on the configuration Tracy may broadcast discovery packets to the local network and
expose the data it collects in the background to that same network. Traces collected by Tracy
may include source and assembly code as well.

As thus, you may want make sure to only enable the `tracing-tracy`, `tracy-client` and
`tracy-client-sys` crates conditionally, via the `enable` feature flag provided by the crates.

## Version support table

This project, unlike Tracy itself, follows semantic versioning. We will publish a breaking version
bump for `tracy-client-sys` whenever there is a potentially breaking protocol change, even if the
`Tracy` project itself does not. An older version of `Tracy` being unable to communicate with the
client of a more recent version is an example of such a breaking change.

`tracy-client`, `tracing-tracy` and other crates also follow semantic versioning, but do not
consider protocol breaks a breaking change for their purposes. For that reason each future version
of `tracy-client` may be able to support depending on a large number of incompatible
`tracy-client-sys` versions. Users are expected to select the version of `Tracy` profiler they
target and use precise version bounds in `Cargo.toml` or `Cargo.lock` to specify the version of
`tracy-client-sys` that they want to use.

The following table lists the version correspondence between the libraries.
